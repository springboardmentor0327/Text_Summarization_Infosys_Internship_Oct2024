## 📜 Project Overview  
This repository contains the work completed as part of my Infosys Springboard internship. The project demonstrates key concepts and practical implementations of Text Summarization using NLP techniques.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Implementation of *Extractive Summarization*  
- Implementation of *Abstractive Summarization*  
- Advanced *Large Language Models (LLMs)* with:  
  - *Stuff Chain*  
  - *Map-Reduce*  
  - *Iterative Refinement*  
- User-friendly *UI with Gradio* for input/output interactions  
  - Accepts text or PDF uploads  
  - Generates summarized content  
  - Displays word count and percentage reduction  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- *Python*  
- *Natural Language Processing (NLP)*  
- *Gradio* for UI development  
- *LangChain Framework*  
- *Machine Learning Models*  
- Libraries: PyPDF2, transformers, spacy, nltk, openai  


## 📊 Demo  
A brief demo of the Gradio interface:  
1. Upload a text file or PDF.  
2. Select the summarization technique.  
3. View the summarized text along with word count and percentage reduction.
