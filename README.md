# Text_Summarization_Infosys_Internship_Oct2024
This Text Summarization Project aims to develop a tool that efficiently condenses long articles, papers, or documents into concise summaries while preserving the key information and context. Utilizing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project focuses on both extractive and abstractive summarization methods.

SUMMARIZATION OF NLP TECHNIQUES
Project Overview
This repository contains implementations of summarization techniques, BLEU/ROUGE scoring, 
advanced LLM techniques, and interactive Gradio applications for various NLP tasks. Below is a 
detailed overview of each file and its purpose.
1. Abstractive Summarization
• File Name: ABSTRACTIVE_SUMMARIZATION.ipynb
• Description:
Implements abstractive summarization techniques using models like T5, BART, and other 
large language models (LLMs). Abstractive summarization generates summaries that go 
beyond simply extracting text; instead, they rephrase or condense the original text while 
maintaining the semantic essence.
• Purpose: 
o Provide a more human-like summary of text.
o Suitable for applications like news summarization, content creation, and more.
• How It Works: 
o Pre-trained models (e.g., T5, BART) are loaded using Hugging Face Transformers.
o Input text is tokenized and passed through the model for inference.
o Output summaries are post-processed to improve readability.
2. Extractive Summarization
• File Name: EXTRACTIVE_SUMMARIZATION.ipynb
• Description:
Utilizes algorithms such as Luhn, LexRank, and KMeans for extractive summarization. This 
approach involves identifying and selecting the most important sentences from the text based 
on statistical and semantic features.
• Purpose: 
o Provides a concise version of text while retaining the original wording.
o Commonly used for document summarization in legal, academic, or corporate 
contexts.
• How It Works: 
o Luhn: Ranks sentences based on term frequency and position.
o LexRank: Calculates sentence importance using a graph-based approach.
o KMeans: Clusters similar sentences and selects representatives for each cluster.
3. Interactive Gradio Application for Summarization
• File Name: GRADIO.ipynb
• Description:
Creates an interactive Gradio application for text summarization. Users can upload text, enter 
URLs, or provide PDFs to generate summaries in real time.
• Purpose: 
o Makes summarization models accessible to non-technical users.
o Facilitates real-time experimentation with summarization techniques.
• How It Works: 
o Integrates the abstractive and extractive summarization models into a Gradio 
interface.
o Accepts multiple input formats and returns the generated summary along with model 
metadata.
4. Evaluation Metrics: BLEU and ROUGE Scoring
• File Name: EVALUATION_BLEU_ROUGE.ipynb
• Description:
Implements BLEU and ROUGE scores to evaluate summarization quality using the 
CNN/DailyMail dataset.
• Purpose: 
o BLEU: Measures n-gram precision by comparing generated summaries with 
reference summaries.
o ROUGE: Focuses on recall, comparing overlaps of unigrams, bigrams, and longer ngrams.
• How It Works: 
o Loads the CNN/DailyMail dataset and pre-processes it for evaluation.
o Runs BLEU and ROUGE scoring scripts to output evaluation metrics for different 
models.
•
5. Advanced LLM Techniques
• File Name: ADVANCED_LLM_TECHNIQUES.ipynb
• Description:
Demonstrates advanced techniques in LangChain, such as MapReduce and iterative 
summarization.
• Purpose: 
o Explores methods to handle large documents effectively.
o Enhances summarization by breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.
• How It Works: 
o MapReduce: Splits text into smaller sections, summarizes each, and combines the 
results.
o Iterative Summarization: Continuously refines summaries by summarizing 
summaries.
6. Gradio App for Advanced Techniques
• File Name: DEVELOPING_GRADIO_FOR_LLM_ADVANCED_MODELS.ipynb
• Description:
Creates an interactive Gradio interface for LangChain-based advanced summarization 
techniques.
• Purpose: 
o Provides a user-friendly way to experiment with MapReduce and iterative 
summarization.
o Allows input in various formats, including URLs and PDFs.
• How It Works: 
o Incorporates advanced techniques and integrates them into a visually appealing 
Gradio app.
•
7. Comprehensive Summarization Gradio App
• File Name: SUMMARIZATION_GRADIO.ipynb
• Description:
A fully integrated Gradio app that combines all summarization techniques (abstractive, 
extractive, advanced) and supports multiple input types like URLs, PDFs, and plain text.
• Purpose: 
o Acts as a one-stop solution for summarization tasks.
o Designed for deployment in real-world use cases such as education, journalism, and 
research.
• How It Works: 
o Allows users to switch between different summarization approaches.
o Processes input data and generates summaries using user-selected methods.
o Outputs include the summary, metadata, and evaluation scores (if applicable).
