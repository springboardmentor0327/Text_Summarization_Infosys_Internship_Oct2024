## 📜 Project Overview  
This repository contains the work completed as part of my Infosys Springboard internship. The project demonstrates key concepts and practical implementations of Text Summarization using NLP techniques.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Implementation of **Extractive Summarization**  
- Implementation of **Abstractive Summarization**  
- Advanced **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with:  
  - **Stuff Chain**  
  - **Map-Reduce**  
  - **Iterative Refinement**  
- User-friendly **UI with Gradio** for input/output interactions  
  - Accepts text or PDF uploads  
  - Generates summarized content  
  - Displays word count and percentage reduction  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- **Gradio** for UI development  
- **LangChain Framework**  
- **Machine Learning Models**  
- Libraries: `PyPDF2`, `transformers`, `spacy`, `nltk`, `openai`  


## 📊 Demo  
A brief demo of the Gradio interface:  
1. Upload a text file or PDF.  
2. Select the summarization technique.  
3. View the summarized text along with word count and percentage reduction.
